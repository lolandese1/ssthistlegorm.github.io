Subject: Access to SS Thistlegorm Website Content Management System

Hi [Content Manager Name],

I'm giving you access to manage content on the SS Thistlegorm website. Here's everything you need to get started:

### Login Information

**Website CMS:** https://ssthistlegorm.com/admin/

**Your Access Token:** [PASTE TOKEN HERE]

**Important:** Keep this token confidential - it's like a password that gives access to edit the website.

### First Time Login Steps

1. Go to https://ssthistlegorm.com/admin/
2. Click "Sign In with GitHub Using Token" (the bottom button)
3. Paste your access token in the text field
4. Click "Sign in"

### About Token Storage

**On Your Personal Computer:**
- You only need to enter the token **once per browser**
- It's saved automatically and persists after closing/reopening the browser
- Just bookmark https://ssthistlegorm.com/admin/ and go straight there next time

**⚠️ On Public/Shared Computers:**
- **ALWAYS use Incognito/Private browsing mode**
- The token will NOT be saved and must be re-entered each session
- This prevents others from accessing the CMS after you leave
- **How to open incognito:**
  - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)
  - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac)
  - Safari: Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)

**Security Rules:**
- ✅ Personal device with only you using it → Regular browser (token saved)
- ⚠️ Shared family/office computer → Incognito mode (token not saved)
- ❌ Public library/internet cafe → Incognito mode REQUIRED

### What You Can Do

The CMS lets you:
- Create and edit blog posts
- Update main website pages (Home, About, Book, Contact, etc.)
- Add content about other wreck sites
- Upload and manage images
- All changes are automatically published to the live website (takes 1-2 minutes to appear)

### Full Documentation

I've created a complete guide for you: https://github.com/lolandese1/ssthistlegorm.github.io/blob/master/CONTENT_MANAGER_GUIDE.md

It includes:
- Detailed usage instructions
- Tips for content editing
- Troubleshooting help
- Security best practices

### Quick Start

Once logged in, you'll see three content collections:
- **Blog Posts** - for news and updates
- **Pages** - for main website pages
- **Other Wrecks** - for wreck documentation

Click any collection to see existing content, or click "New" to create something new.

Looking forward to seeing your content contributions!
