# Diving the SS Thistlegorm

A trip around Thistlegorm today is like traveling through time, and many visitors experience high emotions during the dive. It is, after all a bombsite with highly visible signs of great destruction and loss. It's also a giant underwater museum, a war,, a unique piece of military history, and an opportunity to step into the past during a period when the free world was under threat from one of the most tyrannous regimes of modern times.

Located in the Straits of Gubal, Northern Red Sea, this famous vessel has been the subject of much activity and drama during its two lives as both a seagoing merchant ship and as a world-class diving site.

Despite extensive public knowledge and interest in Thistlegorm, it will continue to inspire a sense of mystery. Jacques Cousteau's visit in 1955 remains the subject of much discussion, and like the legend himself, Thistlegorm continues to attract speculation and controversy from beyond the grave.

Divers can visit the wreck from Sharm El Sheikh by daily boat or during a weeklong safari. Located on a bed of just thirty metres in good visibility, this is the perfect wreck dive where much of the original cargo still remains. The bow is just fifteen metres below the surface, and the propeller at twenty-seven. Measuring over four hundred feet long, SS Thistlegorm often requires several dives to complete an extensive coverage, inside and out.

Currents may occasionally be strong; ,, mooring lines tied by the guide allow divers to make a comfortable descent to the shelter of the wreck. Once inside, divers can explore the ship's holds where time has seemingly stood still. Motorbikes, trucks, guns, and wartime cargo, never to reach their destination, lay stacked where they were loaded back in 1941.

Very recently, a local diver claims that he stumbled across a newly discovered locomotive some one hundred and fifty metres from the wreck. The race is on to reach and photograph the engine together with the ship's funnel, both of which, allegedly, are still attached to the deck, blown clean off the ship by the explosion.

Diving the SS Thistlegorm requires certification as a trained diver, beyond entry level, through a recognised scuba training agency. In any event, divers visit the wreck at their own risk.

# Crew Interviews

Excerpts from live interviews with actual survivors of
SS Thistlegorm under attack in 1941:

### Glyn Owen

"I heard a plane making what appeared to be a second run, or at least sounded like a diving run, and my training I suppose came out and I just flung myself out of my hammock on the deck beneath and crouched behind a winch and then there was just two explosions and a mass of flame and my hammock above my head caught fire."

### Ray Gibson

 "…I was on watch behind the bridge, and next thing there was a big bang, and I realised we had been either bombed or torpedoed, one of the two, but we'd been hit by enemy action….."

### Angus McLeay

 "I made for the side to jump overboard, and the rail was almost red-hot under my hand. I don't know why, but, just as I was going to jump, I looked back and saw the gunner crawling along the deck on the other side. The deck was covered with broken glass, and I had to take the bits out of my feet before I could carry the gunner through the flames, which came up to my chest in places."

### John Whitham

 "I was on watch at twelve o'clock, and about one o'clock we heard the sound of an aircraft. We looked across to the Carlisle and there was nothing indicating from her and the sound of the aircraft got nearer and the first thing that we realised was that he was planting a few bombs on us, which, unfortunately, dropped in number four hold, possible number five, but number four I do know, because there was some flames shooting out from there and we……we'd quite a good fire going for a while."

### Denis Gray

 "…it seemed like two or three minutes I would think, that this huge explosion took place and of course we were looking in the direction of the Thistlegorm at the time and shortly after the explosion there was a huge sheet of flame which lit up both sides of the Red Sea at that point, we could see it light up the Mount Sinai on one side and Egypt on the other side and all the ships and everything around and then all of a sudden there seemed to be a second explosion and still looking in that d irection we were amazed to see what turned out to be a railway engine and it was red hot with sparks flying from it and it was coming in our direction."
